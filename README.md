1) Who are the most effective legislators? Eg those that bills dont get stuck in committee

2) What legislators often work together? Who cosponsors together? Do we see behaviors where certain legislators move outside their associated groups (Potential special interests, corruption etc)

3) What bills are tabled and refiled over each reach? This is a bit more of NLP but the titles should be very similar

4) Really interested in understanding the effectiveness of sponsors, what cosponsors typically work together and do they get through committee

5) What committees (and chairs) halt bills
